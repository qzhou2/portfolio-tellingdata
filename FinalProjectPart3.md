***Things learned From Part 1 & 2 and The Process Along the Way Completing the Final***

   So after l receiving feedbacks from my classmates, friends, and professor, l decide to narrow down my target audience to these who frequently visit fast food store 
like Macdonald and trying to figure out the nutritions that their meal provide. My original work from part 1&2 is like throwing a bunch of fancy visualizations that
l think l will possibly utilize, but there are several feedbacks l had reminding me to come up with a more complete and compelling story instead of
just using some fancy visualizations to tell nothing practical, the best story l can tell should be something myself have experienced with and resonated with 
so that l can persuade others to believe in my story.
  Therefore l decide to start off my works with introducing the daily recommended take-in of nutritions like protein, sugar, carbohydrates, total fat and calories,
the visualizations of these recommendation serve as a tool to let the audience have a sense of specific quantities of nutritions they should consume, and l examine
my goal(get higher protein without passing the red line of other nutritions like sugar, total fat,etc) to my audience to help them stay in the same page with me.
  I used my favorite mean big mac and its nutritional breakdown compared to the recommended value to resonate with my audience since big mac is a super popular items
from Macdonald, my audience can be impressed more with specific example compared to just showing them an overall picture.
  Based on breakfast and lunch&dinner menu, l demonstrate the tables displaying the choices of combos that meet my goal, when running the code to select these
combos,l specifically make each items from combos unique so that the selection will be more diverse and fit people's normal behavior(people tend to have different 
choice of combos to indulge in different yummy food).
  When it comes to conclusion part, l conclude my project with saying that we can definitely get a healthy diet even on fast food store like MacDonald, l hope
my analysis will give my target audience a reference when they want to indulge in fast food without sacrificing their health-related concerns.
