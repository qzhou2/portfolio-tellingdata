**Outline**

***High-Level Summary***

McDonald is one of my favorite fast food chain, as a person who values personal health, this project means to unravel the nutritional components of 
the McDonaldâ€™s menu, l am aiming to shed light on how food choices on McDonald can influence our dietary intake. 
Through a series of data visualizations, this project will break down items on McDonald's menu to several nutritional categories like calorie count, fat, sugar, as well as protein content.
The analysis will serve as a tool to provide consumers and health policy makers with a thorough understanding of the nutritional value in fast food, and potentially guiding healthier
eating decisions and policy development.

***Project Structure***

- *Introduction*: l will discuss the importance of nutritional knowledge in daily food choices,and then l am going to dive into the nutritional analysis of McDonald's menu items.

- *Nutritional Overview*: l will highlight key nutritional figures such as average calorie count, fat, and sugar content, then l will compare the nutritional content per item to recommended daily values.

- *Nutritional Content Breakdown*: l will do visualizations depicting the distribution of calories, fats, sugars, and proteins across the menu, the interactive charts will be created to show the nutrient composition of different menu categories.

- *Impact on diet and health*: l will analyze the relationship between menu choices and nutritional intake, and thus l can make assessment how different menu items can fit into a balanced diet.

- *User Stories*:

         -As a consumer, I want to know the nutritional breakdown of my fast food choices to make informed dietary decisions.

         -As a health policy maker, I will need to understand fast food nutrition to craft guidelines that promote public health.

**Data**

- *Data Source*: The project will utilize a public-available dataset, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts, which title, 'Nutrition Facts for McDonald's Menu'
- *Usage Plan*: This dataset has nutritional information including but not limited to calorie content, total fat, sugar, as well as protein values of each item available on the menu. Our target is to provide an analytical story for demonstrating the nutritional aspects of MacDonald food consumption. By getting insight from the detailed breakdown of nutritional components from each food category, l will explore the impact of these foods on our dietary habits and health.

**Method and medium**

I will use Shorthand as the platform to develop this project for the purpose of creating an informative and engaging story narrative. Infographics, interactive charts, and descriptive text will be utilized in this platform to convey my story of the nutrition breakdown of McDonald.
