The link to original visualization from MakeoverMonday will be: https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w8, 
which is titled as '2023/W8: The Cheapest Ways to Get Your Protein'. It is mainly focus on ranking the popular product with the amount of their protein, it is a super interesting topic for me who is a gymrat and consume a lot of proteins on daily basis.


Sketch out a solution:
![assignment34 sketching](https://github.com/qzhou2/portfolio-tellingdata/assets/122907703/61f1dfcd-07c7-4294-9360-7522d494b037)
The reason why l draw my sketch like this will be due to the reason that l think currently there are a huge population who are vegans, and we should take this into consideration, so l will add a filter along with the visualization, the ranking along with the exact cost labeled on each bar will be needed to give the audience straight point which products is cheaper in terms of the same level of protein .

Test the solution:

Student, mid 20's: He thinks my drawing need to have a filter so that the user can choose to filter either from highest to lowest or from lowest to highest, he also believes l shouldn't use the same color for all the bar, maybe 2-3 colors that are significantly different from each other in visual side will be helpful. After l discuss the idea with him, l think it will great to add another filter to sort my cost order and carefully choosing the color set will be helpful to build my dashboard.

Adult, early 30's: He thinks an average line or other statistic line will be helpful in my case to give the audience a better sense in terms of understanding the data better and quicker, also he mentioned different choice of color to 
represent different level of cost will help me to get a more visual-friendly visualization, he said he is not sure if l need to add more instructive sentence to help the audience understanding the situation. After l discuss my sketch with him, l decide to add an average line to seperate the bar based on above/below average, and different colors will be used to represent the different groups.


After following the instruction from the 'watch me viz' link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45pgu_SrZsg and get inspiration from the feedback, the recreated visualization will be:

var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);

Summary:
I chose the topic of cost of protein since l am a gymrat and values protein intake, but l do have budget for the grocieries l purchased, so l have a strong interest exploring this topic and visualization.
When l drew my sketch, l tried to add vegan filter to make the visualization more practical and helpful for wider range of population since now people who are vegan are all over the place, since the topic is about finding the lowest cost of protein sources, l feel like labeling the exact number of cost on top of each bar will be more informative and intuitive for the target audience. 
After exchanging opinions from my two friends, l decide that average line to seperate these above/below average, and different color choices responding to the two distinct groups, another filter to let the audience to choose sorting from highest to lowest or from lowest to highest, will be helpful to add to my case to make it more visually-appealing.
So compared to the original visualization, l think l am able to fix issues like color set choice(l use two visually-distinct color to highlight the difference between these above against below average), adding two filter to give more options for the audiences to filter the visualization based on their interest(whether they care about budget or vegan), and labelling the exact number of cost to let the audience immediate know the cost instead of wasting their time looking for this information on the graph.
